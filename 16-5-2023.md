Question 7: What is the score? 

In this final puzzle, we bring you to Mars. That’s right - you’re an astronaut now. As part of

the expedition, you’re required to look for lifeforms on the planet. You pull up your scanner,

and scan scan scan.

Unexpectedly, your sensor starts picking up things! However, your space budget didn’t quite

cover scientific equipment and you'll have to make do with its abilities. The sensor scans an

area that fits into a 5x5 grid. The scan shows lifeforms (X), and empty spaces (.)

That’s strange. Your sensor changes quite rapidly - turns out at each minute new lifeforms

appear and existing ones die. After a while, you make the following observation:

1. At each minute, lifeforms live and die based on the number of lifeforms in the four

adjacent tiles. For reference, this is what the adjacent tiles look like (.) based on one lifeform

(X)

.

.X.

.

2. A lifeform passes away, and is replaced by an empty space UNLESS there is EXACTLY

one lifeform adjacent to it.

3. An empty space becomes filled with a lifeform if exactly ONE or TWO lifeforms are

adjacent to it. Otherwise, the lifeform or the empty space remains the same

Taking rules 2 and 3, we observe the following after one minute:

. X

.X. becomes X.X

. X

4. How about the tiles on the edge of the grid? They are considered to have fewer than 4

adjacent tiles, and the missing tiles count as empty space permanently

5. This process happens at every location simultaneously, i.e. you should count the number

of adjacent lifeforms or space for each lifeform, and then update the tiles

Example

Start state:

....X

X..X.

X..XX

..X..

X....

1 minute:

X..X.

XXXX.

XXX.X

XX.XX

.XX..

2 minutes:

XXXXX

....X

....X

...X.

X.XXX

3 minutes:

X....

XXXX.

...XX

X.XX.

.XX.X

4 minutes:

XXXX.

....X

XX..X

.....

XX...

Apart from the rules above, you’re trying to understand what their nature is. You contact HQ,

and HQ says to watch the first time a layout appears twice.

Basically, there will come a time where you will observe the following twice:

.....

.....

.....

X....

.X...

HQ also says to calculate the lifeform score of that layout. Due to some odd configuration in

your communicator, you’ll have to calculate it this way:

2**(the tile number)

Consider each from left to right in the top row as tiles 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the next row as 5, 6, 7,

8, 9, … , and the last row is 20, 21, 22, 23, 24

..... 0 1 2 3 4

..... 5 6 7 8 9

..... 10 11 12 13 14

X.... 15 16 17 18 19

.X... 20 21 22 23 24

The lifeform score is thus

2**15 (32768) + 2**21 (2097152) = 2129920

Question

Consider the following start state:

XXXX.

X....

X..X.

.X.X.

XX.XX

What is the lifeform score for the first layout that appears twice?

# Answer to Day 7 Challenge #

The lifeform score of the repeated layout (first layout that appears twice) is 32509983.

# Algorithm #

1. Define a function `printLayout` that takes a 2D vector representing the current layout and prints it to the console.

2. Define a function `nextMinuteLayout` that takes the current layout as input and returns the layout for the next minute based on the rules of the Game of Life.

3. Initialize the start state of the layout in a 2D vector, `startState`.

4. Print the start state using the `printLayout` function.

5. Create a vector `layouts` to store encountered layouts and push the start state into it.

6. Initialize a variable `minute` to 1 to keep track of the current minute.

7. Enter a while loop that continues indefinitely.

8. Inside the loop, obtain the next layout for the minute by calling the `nextMinuteLayout` function with the last layout in `layouts`.

9. Check if the obtained layout is repeated by comparing it with each layout in `layouts`. If a match is found, break the loop.

10. If the layout is not repeated, add it to `layouts`, print the current minute and the layout using the `printLayout` function, and increment the `minute` variable.

11. After the loop breaks, print the repeated layout and the number of minutes it took to repeat.

12. Calculate the lifeform score of the first layout that appears twice using the analogy given in the example 

The algorithm is a fixed grid size of 5x5, as specified in the provided code. If you want to make the grid size variable, you would need to modify the code accordingly.
