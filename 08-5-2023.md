# Question

Question 3: Is the permutation divisible by 7? 

Given an integer string, create all integer permutations of its digits. Determine if there is a permutation whose integer value is evenly divisible by 7, i.e. (permutation value) mod 7 = 0.

For example, the possible permutations of 789 are p = {789, 798, 879, 897, 978, 987}. Of these values, p[2] and p[5] is divisible by 7 because 879 mod 7 = 0 and 987 mod 7 = 0.

Their average is (879 + 987) / 2 = 933

What you'll need to do is determine if any of the permutations of 1867 are divisible by 7, and if so, what is the average between the smallest and largest permutation? Decimals are  allowed.

## Answer to Day3 Challenge

The average of the smallest and largest divisible permutations is: 5152

## Algorithm

1. Define a string variable to hold the integer string.

2. Generate all permutations of the integer string using a permutation function.

3. Store all the generated permutations in a vector of strings.

4. Loop through each permutation in the vector and convert it to an integer.

5. Check if the integer is divisible by 7.

6. If it is, store the integer in a vector of integers.

7. If there are no integers in the divisible vector, print a message and exit the program.

8. If there are integers in the divisible vector, find the smallest and largest integer.

9. Compute the average of the smallest and largest integer.

10. Print the average.
