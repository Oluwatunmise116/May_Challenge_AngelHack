Question 6: How many steps are needed to disconnect the string? 

A secure communication network has been compromised and the cyber security team must

restore its security. The network, series, is represented as a series of nodes identified using

lowercase English letters. The nodes must be disconnected in order to remove the threat. In

a single operation, any number of adjacent nodes identified by the same character can be

disconnected. Find the minimum number of operations required to disconnect all the nodes

and secure the network.

Example

Suppose we have a series that goes "aabbaa".

To remove the string entirely, you’d first have to get rid of “bb” to get “aaaa” and then you can

remove “aaaa”.

You can remove the first “aa” to get “bbaa” but it means you’d need to spend another two

moves to remove “bb” and then “aa”.

In this case, the minimum number of moves required to delete the entire series is 2.

Another example

Suppose we have another series that goes “aabbbcccaacccaa”.

What’s the minimum number of moves required for this?

You can remove the middle “aa” first to get “aabbbccccccaa” and then remove “cccccc” to

get “aabbbaa”, and then you remove the “bbb” and subsequently “aaaa” to delete the entire

series.

Boom, 4 moves.

What is the minimum number of steps required to delete this series:

# Answer to Day 6 Challenge #

The minimum number of steps required for the series is: 78

# Algorithm #

1. Define a function called `findMinimumDeletion` that takes the left index `l`, right index `r`, a memoization array `dp`, and the input string `s` as input parameters.

2. If there are no characters between the left and right indices (i.e., `l > r`), return 0 since no deletion is needed.

3. If there is only one character at the left and right indices (i.e., `l == r`), return 1 as deleting that character is sufficient.

4. Check if the minimum number of deletions for the current substring (from index `l` to index `r`) has already been computed and stored in the `dp` array. If so, return the stored value.

5. Initialize a variable `res` with the value of 1 plus the minimum number of deletions for the substring starting from the next index (i.e., `l + 1`) to the current right index `r`. This represents the case when a single character is deleted from the substring.

6. Iterate through each index `i` from `l + 1` to `r`:

   - If the character at index `l` is equal to the character at index `i`, calculate the minimum number of deletions by considering two scenarios:

     - Deleting the characters between `l` and `i` (excluding `l` and `i`) by calling `findMinimumDeletion` recursively with the updated left index (`l + 1`) and the new right index (`i - 1`).

     - Deleting the characters starting from index `i` by calling `findMinimumDeletion` recursively with the updated left index (`i`) and the same right index (`r`).

     - Update `res` with the minimum value between `res` and the sum of the two scenarios mentioned above.

7. Store the calculated minimum number of deletions (`res`) in the `dp` array at the corresponding indices (`l`, `r`) for future reference.

8. Return the minimum number of deletions (`res`) for the current substring (from index `l` to index `r`).
