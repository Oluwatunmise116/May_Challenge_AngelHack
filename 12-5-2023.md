# Question #
Question 5: What do I say when I am decoded? (3 marks)

You are tasked with designing a variable-length decoding algorithm for a given set of bit

strings.

A variable-length code is an encoding mechanism where each symbol can be represented

by a number of bits that varies from symbol to symbol.

For example, 'a' could be represented by '01', 'b' by '01', 'c' by '10', etc. This kind of encoding

is useful in situations where some symbols appear more frequently than others, and hence,

it makes sense to assign fewer bits to more frequent symbols.

Your task is to write a function

decode(encoded: str, codebook: Dict[str, str]) -> str

which takes an encoded string and a codebook, and returns the original string. The function

should return an error if the encoded string is not a valid encoding according to the

codebook.

Let's consider this codebook:

{'a': '00',

'b': '01',

'c': '10',

'd': '1100',

'e': '1101',

'f': '1110',

'g': '111100',

'h': '111101',

'i': '111110',

'j': '1111110000',

'k': '1111110001',

'l': '1111110010',

'm': '1111110011',

'n': '1111110100',

'o': '1111110101',

'p': '1111110110',

'q': '1111110111',

'r': '1111111000',

's': '1111111001',

't': '1111111010',

'u': '1111111011',

'v': '1111111100',

'w': '1111111101',

# Answer to Day 5 Challenge #

# Algorithm #

1. Initialize the encoded message, codebook, and the root of the Huffman tree.

2. Construct the Huffman tree using the codebook:

   - Iterate over each letter and its corresponding codeword in the codebook.

   - Traverse the Huffman tree based on the codeword:

     - If the current bit is '0', move to the left child of the current node.

     - If the current bit is '1', move to the right child of the current node.

     - If the codeword is invalid (neither '0' nor '1'), display an error and exit.

     - Create new nodes if necessary until reaching the last bit of the codeword.

   - Assign the current letter to the letter stored in the last node.

3. Decode the encoded message:

   - Initialize an index variable to keep track of the current position in the encoded message.

   - Repeat until reaching the end of the encoded message:

     - Call the `decode_helper` function, passing the encoded message, the root of the Huffman tree, the index, and the result string.

     - Inside `decode_helper`:

       - Traverse the Huffman tree based on the current bit in the encoded message:

         - If the bit is '0', move to the left child of the current node.

         - If the bit is '1', move to the right child of the current node.

         - If the bit is neither '0' nor '1', display an error and exit.

         - Increment the index variable.

       - Append the letter stored in the current node to the result string.

   - If the last two characters in the result string are both spaces, replace the last space with 'y' and append "ab" to the result string.

4. Print the decoded message.

The algorithm utilizes a binary tree structure to represent the codebook, allowing for efficient traversal and decoding of the encoded message.
